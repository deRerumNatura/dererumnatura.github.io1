                    <p>If Teleaders make any clause in these terms of services invalid, the remaining clauses remain
                        fully applicable and Teleaders, and the client may replace the invalid clause with another
                        phrase that reflects the purpose of the invalid clause. However, all modifications, changes, or
                        adjustments to these terms of service remain the sole right of Teleaders.</p>

                    </p>
                    <h4>Offers, Orders, Quotations and Order Confirmations</h4>
                    <p>No proposal or quotations from Teleaders bind the client until accepted by the client. The
                        agreement becomes active as soon as the client returns the quotation, signs the contract, and
                        without amendment within 30 days.
                    </p>
                    <p>All orders placed or order confirmations previously issued by the client binds them to the
                        agreement and replaces all already concluded verbal/written agreements on the same subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>The client may, however, cancel an order if Teleaders has not yet begun the execution of the
                        Project. Clients can withdraw by sending an email to … Teleaders may charge a cancellation fee
                        of …. For all expenses and commitments already made.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Services/Implementation Period</h4>
                    <p>Upon registration with Teleaders, clients will receive notifications of implementation, which are
                        merely indicative, and not binding to Teleaders. Any delay in delivering the Project does not
                        entitle the client to compensation, price reduction, or cancellation of the agreement. </p>
                    <p>If the party explicitly agrees to a binding delivery period, then this period is extended when
                        the client fails to meet its obligations in providing specific information necessary for the
                        facilitation of the Project...</p>
                    <p>The agreement shall be terminated without further notice of default requirement in the event of
                        the dissolution, apparent incapacity, bankruptcy, or death of the client.</p>

                        client which must be equal to the gross annual salary usually paid by Teleaders to the said
                        employee(s)</p>

                        client and will be returned if the sales agreement is terminated as far as there are no
                        outstanding invoices.</p>
                    <p>The parties also agree that all products and information, including commercial and technical
                        information, applications, inventions, as well as professional secrets learned from either
                        party, even following the termination of the agreement, must remain confidential. All said
                        properties are only allowed to be used within the execution of the Project.

                        dispute must be made within 15 days of receiving the invoice to Teleaders. Under no events, can
                        a dispute justify suspending or postponing payment.</p>

                        invoices and must do so on/before the expiry date by bank transfer to the Teleaders account.</p>
                    <p>If a customer does not make payments within (8) days after receiving a warning notification from

                        account for the cost of debt collection and a fixed-rate compensation damage of 10% of the
                        invoice amount may also be charged</p>
                    <p>Teleaders reserves the right to fulfill or suspend all further obligations until the client has
                        paid all overdue invoices. If the client further delays payment of all sums payable, Teleaders
                        is entitled to terminate the contract and stop all services in full or part, temporarily or
